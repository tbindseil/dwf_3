TODO
1. make a linter
1a. camel case instead of snake case
2. whats the best way to deal with importing my own code? backend/index.ts line 2
3. vim buffers move to back
4. move method and entity constants to their own file (backend handlers dir)
5. rename handler dir to api
6. need to find a more generic way to verify that an object matches an interface (see post picture input in post picture api)
7. wrap " console.log(`blank is: ${blank}`); "


ok, i think i would like to go a different direction
I think the client should just stream (the differences), and the server should save

so,
canvas.click sends pixel update to server, but does not update the image
the server then receives and broadcasts to all clients, including the sender
this way, the server is ensuring a consistent order,
this will likely involve an ack on the client end to ensure that the updates are received before sending the next



color order
// red: 0xff, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff
// green: 0x00, 0xff, 0x00, 0xff
// blue: 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xff



now, time for the queue stuff
I'll be working on put client api

what has to go there?

0. establish some mechanism for tracking (in memory) a picture's queue - done
1a. if no clients, add requested client and syncing client - done
1b. if clients exist, add requested client - done
2. when a client registers, the update queue is locked
looks like I need an update queue


before diving into the update queue, i checked on locking and was reminded that node is single threaded
what this means, not fully sure yet
maybe I'll just ignore locking for now, and see if I can understand what is happneing in the context of the code that i write
even after a little bit of code has been implemented i can see a problem

here is the sequence of events and yields that is problematic:
1. user registers
2. reading the file yields
3. while file is being read, another user posts an update to the same photo
4. well, as long as they register for the queue before blocking, things are ok
5. also post update needs to not block
6. but blocking to read input is weird


basically, this is gonna require some dedicated testing machinery


or maybe there are alternatives to this at a high level
like:
1. post every update to a database



before I even do any of the below, we need to
(upon post picture)
1. create an empty 100x100 png
2. upload it to s3
3. get key (assuming same bucket for now)
4. no no no
5. i don't wanna deal with aws yet

so,
0. for prototype pattern, create empty white png - done base_directory/pictures/default/solid_white.png
(upon post picture)
1. create an empty 100x100 png (use the prototype pattern here!) - done
2. save it to a directory on local machine - done
3. add location, ie local file system, and key, ie filename as picture name + user name + time stamp, to row in pictures db - done
3a. maybe add created by also? - done
4. upon get pictures, return those extra fields as well - done
5. have a get picture api wehre the actual file is transferred, this is now possible with the location field - done


hmmm, how do i handle this?
well, updates are commands, and they are sent through a chain of commands
so far, the chain is just two,

no,

the picture updater sends to all subscribed clients in addition to updating the master copy of the picture, as if the master copy of the picture is a subscribed client

so, there are two cases for when a new client subscribes to a picture
1. they are the first client
2. they are not the first client

if 1,
set everything up
* set of clients, initially it is this first subscriber and the master photo handler
** so, objects are:
*** client => subscribed client
          |=> master copy client

    client has an interface that is:
    handle update, subscribed client . handle update serializes and sends to the client (is that an ip address? probably a socket actually)
                   master copy client . handle update implements the same logic as a client does on the front end, ie it updates the photo
    initialize,    subscribed client . initialize will create a socket to send the serialized updates to the client
                   master copy client . intialize will open the photo from an accessor (local file system for now, s3 later)
if 2,
add the client to the set of clients, basically call initialize on the client, add it to the set, and we're good to go


so, put client should include enough info to initialize the client and the master copy client, this is the photo id, and the client ip address

lastly, how should the server respond to a client that is registering? I think they --should-- have to respond with a copy of the picture at the point in time of registration
  ie, the server will lock the picture, register the client, send the picture as a png to the client, then unlock

the only thing that is coming to mind as a little funky is that the client will have to get the picture setup and then start processing updates,
    (or it has to lock everything down till its done setting the picture up but that is obviously dumb)






ok, so now I have the ability to read input params,
to finalize the routing and handling of requests, i need to figure out errors
then, i need to figure out how to learn about objects that are posted/fetched/deleted etc for returning message to clients




orm and db management:
* maybe could translate ts models to python models, then just use sql alchemy
** this leaves the actual ORM to custom typescript stuff
** this also adds the translation of ts modules to python modules up to me also
*** this might be the deal breaker but is worth investigation
** could this be done by reading alembic from the database?


random text from index.ts
// now i have to connect to a database - TJTAG
// this will involve:
// 1. autogenerating database stuff based on models
// 2. connecting securely
//
// well, there are no good ORMs for typescript
//
// so what do i want it to do?
// given models (models/picture.ts for example):
// 1. I should be able to get the database looking right
// 1a. maybe just show differences?
// 2. I should be able to save and access objects, maybe autogenerate some basic queries
// 2a. nothing fancy, just get once and update on command
//
// connecting is a whole separate thing, that I probably should do first

Ok, I haven't kept up with this file, but I have kept up with the proj
now, I am addressing the crux of the project up until this point
I need to synchronize the BroadcastMediator...

methods:
addClient:
* asynchronous in that it:
* certainly reads the raster from localPictureAccesor for the first client
* needs to supply the raster and any pending potentially, not sure how to do this yet
removeClient
* not marked as async, but it does yield control
** when the last client is removed, and picture sync client is closed 
*** it waits for the completion of its queue and then waits for the picture to be written
handleUpdate
* atomic (it doesn't yield control)
periodicWriteQueue
* writes every 30 seconds, instantiated and controlled by PictureSyncClient

questions:
* how many rasters are at play?


things that can happen

* add client_1 to new picture
* add client_2 to already picture
* add client_n to already picture
* client_1 sends an update
* client_2 sends an update
* client_n sends an update
* client_1 leaves
* client_2 leaves
* client_n leaves

except thay can all happen in any order

maybe i can write the tests first
I think just reasoning these things out is enough for now

whoops, I just started

// for undo, a circular buffer as big as the raster
// each buffer is just the blot of an update
this doesn't make any sense at all

// TODO should be able to invoke this multiple times simultaneously
// note, numClients and numb updats will be ignored... shjould probably be a wrapper
testsFromFile(previousUpdatesFilename?: string) {
  let updates: Updates[][] = previousUpdatesFilename ? recoverUpdates(previousUpdatesFilename) : generateUpdates();
  tests(updates)
}

testsFromRandom(numClients: number, numUpdates: Map<number, PixelUpdate>) {
  let updates: Update[][] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < numClients; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j < numUpdates.get(i); ++j) {
      updates.push(makeRandomUpdate());
    }
  }
  tests(updates);
}

tests(updates: Update[][]) {
  // write first incase we crash
  writeToFile(JSON.stringify(updates), 'savedUpdates.json' + timestamp);

  const clients = Promise<void>[];
  updates.forEach(updates => {
    clients.push(spawnClient(updates));
  }

  Promise.awaitAll(clients);

  // TODO await...


  // do we want to kick them all off?
  // naw, let that be part of the randomness for now
  // TODO instead, more complicated, repeat them
}

import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const ENDPOINT = 'http://127.0.0.1:6543/';

connectAsClient() {
  return io(ENDPOINT);
}

async spawnClient(updates: Update[]): Promise<void> {
  const socket = connectAsClient()

  console.log(`spawning client with socketId: ${socket.id}`);

  // need to forloop to serialize these
  for (let i = 0; i < updates.lenth; ++i) {
    let u = updates[i];
    socket.emit('client_to_server_udpate', u.pixelUpdate);
    await delay(u.waitTimeMS);
  }

  // TODO is this the right call?
  socket.close();
}

interface Update {
  waitTimeMS: number;
  pixelUpdate: PixelUpdate;
}

makeRandomUpdate(): Update {
  const waitTimeMS = randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(100);
  const pixelUpdate = {
    x: randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(PICTURE_WIDTH),
    y: randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(PICTURE_HEIGHT),
    red: randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(255),
    green: randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(255),
    blue: randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(255)
  }

  return {
    waitTimeMS,
    pixelUpdate
  };
}

randomNumberBetweenZeroAnd(high: number): number {
  return Math.floor(high * Math.random());
}

delay(ms: number) {
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));
}

...
oh boy

and the tests can call something that can be injected as well
